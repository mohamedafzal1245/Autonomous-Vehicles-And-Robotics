🧭 How It Works

1. Perception

Collects input from multiple sensors and processes them to understand the environment.



2. Localization

Determines the vehicle or robot’s position using GPS and sensor fusion.



3. Path Planning

Calculates the best path using AI algorithms while avoiding obstacles.



4. Decision Making

Detects traffic signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles; makes real-time decisions.



5. Motion Control

Sends signals to motors and actuators for steering, speed control, and stopping.



6. Simulation & Testing

Validated in simulators before real-world deployment for safety and accuracy.# Autonomous-Vehicles-And-Robotics
